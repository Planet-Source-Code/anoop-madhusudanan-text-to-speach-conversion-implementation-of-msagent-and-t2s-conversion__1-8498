USING THIS CODE:
============================================================================
Kindly read this before using this program:

1) You need MSAgent core components and TrueVoic text 2 speach engine. If you do not have these components installed, try opening the HTML file included with this (after going online) for downloading and installing them automatically, before opening the code in VB.

2) If you have MSAGENT control Version 2 installed (with MSOffice 2000), VB will ask u whether u need to update the control to version 2 (I used version 1.5). I think version 2 control can handle version 1.5 characters. Also, you can use characters that comes with MSOffice 2000, if u have version 2 control.

3) If u r interested, contact me for knowing how to handle speech input with MSAgent. I can tell u if I will get enough time. (I will soon post a code peice to planet)

4) Also, r u a US based programmer? I am looking for creating tie-ups with established US companies for implementing Web Phone services and Internet Radio Stations using the latest broadcasting technology I developed, and is planning to relocate to US shortly. Kindly visit my website http://www.geocities.com/streamingaudio if u have enough time. I would be gratefull if you can provide me information regarding finding investors/sponsors in US for my ventures
